<h2>Goal</h2>
Same principle as stack1,  `modified` variable is declared followed by `buffer` variable which again is 64 bytes. A third variable aptly named `variable` is declared, and set to the environment variable `GREENIE`.
`variable` is then strcpy to `buffer`.  The code then checks if `modified` variable is `0x0d0a0d0a` (again little endian). So in order for this to work the environment variable `GREENIE` needs to be set with 64bytes of anything, and a 65th byte value of `\x0a\x0d\x0a\x0d`.

<h2>Solution</h2>
Set the enviornment variable `GREENIE` in bash:
```export GREENIE=`python -c 'print "A"*64+"\x0a\x0d\x0a\x0d"'```

Run the program and it should print out the success message
`./stack2`

If this does not work the value of the environment variable can be checked with the command: `$GREENIE`
